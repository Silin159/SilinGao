Hello! My name is Deniz and I am a first year PhD student in computer science advised by [Antoine Bosselut](https://atcbosselut.github.io/) at [EPFL - IC](https://www.epfl.ch/schools/ic/).
I was previously advised by [Stefanie Tellex](https://cs.brown.edu/people/stellex/) and [Ellie Pavlick](https://cs.brown.edu/people/epavlick/) in the [Department of Computer Science at Brown](https://cs.brown.edu/).
My research interests lie in the areas of NLU + ML. Outside of research I like playing with sound and training my cat. Feel free to reach out to via email. ~
