I am a PhD student at [EPFL NLP Group](https://search.epfl.ch/?filter=unit&q=NLP), working with Prof. [Antoine Bosselut](https://atcbosselut.github.io/). I am interested in knowledge intensive natural language inference, understanding and generation, especially knowledge graph enhanced language modeling and its downstream applications such as conversational and narrative systems.

Previously, I was a research assistant in the [CoAI Group](http://coai.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/) at Tsinghua University, working with Prof. [Minlie Huang](http://coai.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/hml). I also received my Bachelor's degree in [Electronic Information Science and Technology](https://www.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) at Tsinghua University, with my diploma thesis advisor Prof. [Zhijian Ou](http://oa.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/ouzhijian/).
